# What is Data?

## Definition
**Data** is a collection of facts, figures, symbols, or information that is raw and unprocessed. It represents observations, measurements, or descriptions of phenomena. Data serves as the foundation for information and knowledge creation through processing and analysis.

---

## Etymology
The word "data" comes from the Latin word "datum," which means "something given." It is the plural form of datum, though in modern usage, "data" is often treated as both singular and plural.

## Types of Data

### 1. **Qualitative Data**
Data that describes qualities or characteristics without numerical values.

**Characteristics:**
- Descriptive in nature
- Non-numerical
- Based on observations and descriptions
- Hard to measure

**Examples:**
- Colors (red, blue, green)
- Emotions (happy, sad, excited)
- Feedback and testimonials
- Descriptions and narratives
- Opinions and preferences

### 2. **Quantitative Data**
Data that is numerical and can be measured and quantified.

**Characteristics:**
- Measurable and numerical
- Can be counted or calculated
- Objective and concrete
- Easy to analyze statistically

**Examples:**
- Heights and weights
- Temperatures
- Sales figures
- Age and income
- Test scores
- Quantities and counts
