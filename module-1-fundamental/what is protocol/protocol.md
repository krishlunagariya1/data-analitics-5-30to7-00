# Protocol — Definition

A protocol is a formal set of rules that defines how two or more entities communicate or interact. It specifies message formats, sequencing/state, error handling, and expected behaviors so parties can interoperate reliably.

## Key elements
- Syntax / message format (what a message looks like)  
- Semantics (what each message means)  
- State & sequencing (allowed order of messages)  
- Error handling & recovery  
- Versioning and compatibility  
- Security (authentication, encryption)

## Common examples
- Network: HTTP, TCP/IP, SMTP, WebSocket  
- APIs: REST contract, gRPC proto definitions  
- Programming: interfaces/protocols in Swift, Java interfaces

## Minimal example (HTTP request)
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  
Host: example.com

## Why it matters
Protocols enable interoperability, predictable behavior, and clear contracts between systems or components.
